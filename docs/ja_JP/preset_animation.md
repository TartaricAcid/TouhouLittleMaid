# プリセット アニメーション

There are many default animations built in the mod, you only need:

1. Set the correct name for the group you want to animate in Blockbench.
2. Call the animation reference of the path in the `animation` field of the `maid_model.json` file.

> The `tlm-utils` plugin can automatically call the animation script reference based on the group name, you just need to click the `Re-Analyze Animation` button.
